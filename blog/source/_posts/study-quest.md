## Project Description
Study Quest is a project that blends the excitement of [Kahoot!](https://kahoot.com/) with the adventurous spirit of [Dragon Quest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Quest). Our aim was to create a more engaging learning environment by incorporating quiz sets, which can be created by either students or teachers, into a gamified setting.

## My Role

As a web developer in the team, my responsibilities included:

- Developing a forum using **PHP7** for user interactions, where users could communicate and admins could post blog entries.
- Implementing **MySQL** for managing and storing quiz sets, blog posts, and forum discussions.
- Crafting a basic 4-page website using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, which included embedding the game as a Unity WebGL project.
