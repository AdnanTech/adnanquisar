Originally a draft named 25 rules for 25, for my 25th birthday, I almost didn't post this and instead deleted it. I’ve renamed this post to 25 things I’d tell myself 10 years ago, deciding to put it out there to help anyone that felt as lost as I did navigating my early adult life.

# 1. Aim for the stars, land on the moon
You have to believe your ideas fully, because optimism and having faith in yourself can often get you further than not believing in yourself ever will. In the pursuit of greatness, you have to aim for the stars with complete trust in yourself, and harness enough delusional optimism to be misunderstood by others.

When I was 23, I proposed my research idea for a summer project using this quote, a great lecturer I was having a chat with responded to this quote with “Don’t crash land back into earth”. Whilst taken aback in the moment, I’ve come to realise that by crash landing back into earth you’re back where you started with better experience, it’s not a bad thing if you enjoyed the journey. Similar to a rogue-like game, you can always try again with better equipment. I’ve found that by dreaming big in this way, even if your trajectory is short you’ll have a higher chance of repeatedly achieving great things.

# 2. Time is money, and money is time
Time is the most important resource we all own. If you’re like me and you’re employed, you are working for what you are willing to paid, trading your time for money. This is important to understand because it reveals the scope of money further, that it’s a function rather than a resource. There are two things you need to understand when it comes to money.

You have to understand **what money be a function for**, you can trade your money back for time, you can trade your money for energy (hiring, healthy food) and money for fun (video games, eating out, movies at the cinema). These are just some ideas around what money can be used as a function for, but the possibilities are virtually endless.

The second thing you need to understand is that you have to **respect money and be indifferent towards it**. Money does not care who you are, so you have to remove all emotional barriers to money if possible. This means understanding what it can and can’t buy you. Be aware of what money is, it’s function, and be indifferent to the amount of money, as it’s just a function. Money does not care if you are using the money for malicious activity, being greedy or gambling it away, it’s just the medium currency that is being used for the activity. This can be flipped on it’s head, you can learn to positively be indifferent to money, and use it for good things to support yourself and your family.

# 3. Love deeply
Love the people around you and the work you do. Try to build a small amount of meaningful connections rather than a lot of shallow ones. Appreciate the support network you have and try to love deeply by contributing to your loved one’s support systems if you are in a position to do so.

# 4. Work hard
But work hard selectively, on things that matter to you. Try to work with interesting and smart people. If done right, working hard can give you momentum and more energy. Pick your battles wisely, as you can only work so hard for a certain amount a day.

Always remember that hard work never goes to waste, seriously. Even if you don’t get the results you want from hard work, the experience gained is invaluable moving forwards.

A term I got infamous for at university was my adoption of min-maxing. I would rigorously try to apply the 80/20 rule as I found it an efficient way to balance so many activities on top of my studies. This aimed to cut down bikeshedding and spend the minimum time required to get the maximum results, within reason, implying that there is a point of diminishing returns. This was further supported by the fact that 70% in a UK university is the same grade as a 100%. This should give some perspective on how to work hard selectively - I was happy to spend more time on modules that mattered to me, and less time on modules that mattered less, averaging out to a healthy grade and learning more content that was relevant to my career, and most importantly having more time to spend on other things that mattered more to me, such as people, side projects and job interview preparation.

# 5. Nobody’s watching
When is the last time you ran for public transport? I recently told my friend I felt embarrassed to run for the train after work in my corporate attire. His response was one I’ll remember forever. He said, “So what? No one will remember that, all the people you cross in London whilst running for train, you’ll probably never see again”. That’s when it clocked, a lot of my embarrassment was in my head. Try not to feel embarrassed about people watching you in public, or getting anxious about something that hasn’t happened, because the likelihood is that only one who cares, is you. What if they do know you? They probably won’t care unless it affects them.

That’s the beauty of life, everyone is so busy doing their own things that they won’t bother to pay attention to you. Attention is becoming a commodity, people need a good reason to pay attention to you, meaning the ball is in your court.

# 6. Focus is a muscle
I've seen so many great people lose touch with the world due to a lack of focus. Often stemming from an unhealthy relationship with social media or doomscrolling, their focus muscles have diminished over time, and thereby their dreams. Respect long-form content and read books to build back your focus. Make social media interactions meaningful. Focus for long periods of time.

# 7. Learn to disconnect
The best thinking is often done offline.

# 8. Summer is the best
The United Kingdom gets about 3 months of sun a year, June, July and August. Enjoy them whilst they last.

# 9. Take risks
Risk is subjective and needs to be evaluated each time. Even on both sides of the same deal, both parties may have a different amount of risk they are taking on. The successful risk takers understand this concept and evaluate both their risk and counter party risk when taking a risk. Figure out what defines your risk.

To take this one step further, somebody that has a family and a mortgage to account for has a much larger risk profile than an 18 year old living at home. Youth is a super power for risk, as liabilities are a hindrance to risk, which you often get more of as you age.

Measure opportunity cost, what do you lose by taking this risk? A textbook example of this is a Masters degree. You pay a substantial sum, for a chance to get a better job that you may not have been able to get with an undergraduate degree. Is this worth the trade-off? There are many variables.

# 10. Be malleable, but stand firm.
Be disciplined, but remain open. Adaptability and initiative are two key skills you’ll need for life. Initiative in a corporate environment if often met with bureaucracy and push back. Try to fight the bullshit but pick your battles wisely, sometimes they aren’t worth it.

# 11. Decisions and Sacrifice are everything
They make up a lot of day to day living, and have a butterfly effect on everything else.

# 12. Health is part of wealth
It’s cool to be healthy, healthy food doesn’t have to be salad, salads can taste nice, your tomorrow self will be much fitter and energised with a clean diet.

# 13. Learn to fail gracefully
If you’re human, you will fail at times. Learning to take this on the chin, and understand what went wrong with no pride is how you fail gracefully and increase chances of success the next time. I’ve failed more than I’ve succeeded, my ability to bounce back is the reason I’ve achieved great things.

# 14. Take on responsibility, to learn to lead
Interpersonal skills are valuable and heard to get, in both a leader and follower position. Getting leader experience is much harder than being a follower. To get more leader experience it tends to come from taking on responsibility, opt-in for more public speaking early on to improve your confidence and build life skills, it's invaluable.

# 15. Assets and Liabilities
Liabilities are things you owe, assets are things you own. Sit down and define them properly. Do you pay a monthly phone bill? That’s a liability, a required one. Did you finance your car? Try to buy it with cash, the less liabilities, the better. What assets would you like to own? How many liabilities can you afford to not take on?

The most important asset you will ever own is freedom.

# 16. Your worth is not tied to your achievements
You’ll always be worth more. Failing an exam might feel like a big issue today, but you will forget about it in a week, if not a month. There is an immense pressure for the youth to perform in academia, but life is about learning and not overfitting for grades. 

# 17. Manage your infrastructure
This leans on some of the money concepts we’ve talked about. Owning your infrastructure whilst your young means being in control if your education and free time. You’ll have to attend school and study, but try to manage your own time outside of that. Your body, mind, money and brain all need to be managed well. When you’re older, this usually means managing your money and debt.

Think about what is outsourced in your life and ask yourself if you can insource it instead, as this allows you to control it.

# 18. Smile more & forgive yourself
Find ways to be happy in unhappy times and places. Forgive yourself more, it’s your first time living life.

# 19. Travel if you can
Travelling gives you perspective. Different countries have different systems, cultures and customs. It’s arguably the best way to actually see and compare different systems to your own country. Countries are massive systems with lots of depth that have to be experienced, not read from a textbook.

# 20. Stand for whats right, but be ready to be wrong
You have to fight bullshit and bureaucracy, always, but with caution. It can be unwise and crass to pick certain battles, do your best to minimise friction and build a better system for everyone around you.

# 21. Have goals
Every decade, every year, every quarter, every month, every week, every day. Try to make little progress to each goal in each category by breaking down complex, long term goals into smaller, more manageable ones. The 1% rule leads to compounding growth.

# 22. Life changing money isn't an amount
it's situational to your circumstances. Warren Buffet is one of the wealthiest men on earth, but you’d be crazy to swap positions with him as he is short on time, he’s 94. Even with all his billions, he’d likely trade it back for time. To a young man, a small sum of cash could change the trajectory of their life for the better. To somebody in debt, they may need a large sum of cash to change the trajectory of their life.

I’d tell my younger self this because I’d always put a value on it, and the more I think about putting a value on a life changing amount of money the less it makes sense. A million quid might change your life, but it won’t mean much if you waste it all on super cars within a week.

# 23. Create value for others
I learned to love building things that created value, but it would often be for myself. If I could do it all again I’d still try to build things that make my life easier, but learn that real value is created when others find your creations useful.

# 24. Uncertainty as a catalyst
Risk is in the category of uncertainty and they relate closely. Uncertainty is a scale, meaning it’s not a binary state, and being uncertain has been shown to increase curiosity, but in-turn decreases happiness. However, uncertainty is also an opportunity for growth, it challenges you to question your assumptions and seek alternative answers.

By being aware of how much uncertainty you have, you can be aware of why you feel the way you feel. When you start a new project there are so many uncertainties that might lead to dread. So when you become curious you start to find the way, and finding the way leads to the exchange of uncertainty for happiness and new skills.

Essentially, curiosity becomes your compass for learning, and when we are young we are much more curious, so use this to your advantage and be curious. Read more and learn voraciously.

# 25. Own your story
Your quirks and flaws become your identity. Own them with pride, you’re the first and only you in all of humanity. Once I accepted this concept and embraced it, my confidence and a young person shot up. I’m not perfect, I’m me.

I’m now a young professional in London in one of the largest banks in the world. When I was younger, I had to learn a lot of things that I wish someone would have told me earlier.

I’ve been lucky enough to meet great people, have amazing experiences, and build great things. If you’ve found this post helpful, I’d suggest documenting your story too. Aim for the stars, land on the moon.
