Study Quest was a project that blends the excitement of [Kahoot!](https://kahoot.com/) with the adventurous spirit of [Dragon Quest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Quest). The aim was to create a more engaging learning environment by incorporating quiz sets, which can be created by either students or teachers, into a gamified setting.

My responsibilities included developing community engagement and user generated content features for the app, creating a forum using PHP7 for user interactions, where users could communicate and admins could post blog entries. I also implemented a MySQL database for managing and storing quiz sets, blog posts, and forum discussions for users to share their quiz sets. By the end, I had created a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web app using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, embedding the game as a Unity WebGL project.

We placed 2nd Place for 'Best University Team' and 3rd Place in the 'Better Learning' Category. The experience of a remote hackathon was unique, as you're not surrounded by other hackers and sleeping on a couch. Nevertheless, the experience was invaluable.
