## Who Am I
My name is Adnan, and I am a final-year Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence Student at the University of Sussex. In recent years, my areas of interest have gravitated towards natural language processing and computational finance in recent years.


I have a few years of tech related work experience including summer positions as a Junior Researcher at the [University of Sussex](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/ai-research-group/research/nlp), a Software Engineering Intern at a [Cloud Native Core Banking Scale‑Up](https://www.thoughtmachine.net/). I have also worked full-time as a Software Engineer at a [Real Time Financial News Company](https://www.financialjuice.com/) and a Software Developer at a [Maritime Data & Analytics Start-Up](https://tradeviews.net/).

During my time at university, I have engaged in extra-curriculars such as being the Vice-President of  the computer science society, [HackSussex](https://www.hacksussex.com/), a Peer Assisted Learning Tutor and a Teaching Assistant for Artificial Intelligence related undergraduate modules.
