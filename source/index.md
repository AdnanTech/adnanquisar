## Who Am I
My name is Adnan, and I'm an incoming Junior Software Engineer at [Macquarie Group](https://www.macquarie.com/). I have just graduated with First-Class honours in Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence degree at the [University of Sussex](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/). In recent years, my areas of interest have gravitated towards natural language processing and computational finance.

I have a few years of tech related work experience including summer positions as a Junior Researcher at the [University of Sussex](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/ai-research-group/research/nlp), a Software Engineering Intern at a [Cloud Native Core Banking Scale‑Up](https://www.thoughtmachine.net/). I have also worked full-time as a Software Engineer at a [Real Time Financial News Company](https://www.financialjuice.com/) and a Software Developer at a [Maritime Data & Analytics Start-Up](https://tradeviews.net/).

During my time at university, I have engaged in extra-curriculars such as being the Vice-President of the computer science society, [HackSussex](https://www.hacksussex.com/), a [Peer Assisted Learning](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/ei/internal/forstudents/informatics/undergraduate/pal) Tutor and a Teaching Assistant for Artificial Intelligence related undergraduate modules.
