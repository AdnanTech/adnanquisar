## Who Am I
My name is Adnan, and I am a final-year Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence Student at the University of Sussex. In recent years, my areas of interest have gravitated towards natural language processing and computational finance in recent years.

During my time at university, I have engaged in extra-curriculars such as being the Vice-President of [HackSussex](https://www.hacksussex.com/), a Peer Assisted Learning Tutor and a Teaching Assistant for the Natural Language Engineering Undergraduate Module. 

I have a few years of tech related work experience including a position as a Junior Researcher at the [University of Sussex](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/ai-research-group/research/nlp), a Software Engineering Intern at a [Cloud Native Core Banking Scale‑Up](https://www.thoughtmachine.net/), a Software Engineer at a [Real Time Financial News Company](https://www.financialjuice.com/) and a Software Developer at a [Maritime Data & Analytics Start-Up](https://tradeviews.net/).

## Projects
I recently built a trading bot based on Telegram Messages, along with a library to back-test, live test, and generate performance reports.
