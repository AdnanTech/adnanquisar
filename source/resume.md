## Education

### University of Sussex, (Sep 2020 – May 2024)
I have graduated with a BSc in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence with First-Class Honours. MMy time at Sussex has been nothing short of extraordinary. The culture there allowed me to cultivate a great skillset, gaining both technical and non-technical skills. During my undergraduate degree, lecturers have been receptive to having conversations regarding my career and my research interests which played a great part in laying the foundations for where I want my future career to go.

I've taken part in multiple extracurriculars, having rebuilt the Computer Science Society with my peers, including writing the HackSussex website from the ground up in React, to becoming the **Vice President** responsible for leading a team of 20 students, managing new workflows and honing leadership skills. I also presented the [annual coding competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPifHEfu4Qs) at Sussex, and assisted in organising the HackSussex GameJam and [HackSussex's biggest hackathon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmKBSb7kbTY) to date, with over 200 attendees! I have been a **Teaching Assistant** for artificial intelligence related modules such as Natural Language Engineering, Computer Vision and Acquired Intelligence & Adaptive Behaviour. I've also been a **Peer Assisted Learning (PAL) Tutor**, working with a team of 15 to host programming support workshops, organise talks on growing a career within the tech space and facilitate weekly drop-in sessions to assist students in debugging code.

My Bachelor’s Thesis is ["Inventory Forecasting in the Crude Oil Market using Natural Language Processing"](https://adnanquisar.com/crude-oil-inventory-forecasting/), and was an interesting journey that involved taking the U.S. Crude Oil Inventories weekly announcement and forecasting future inventory values using neural network models with numerous input features including natural language such as breaking financial news headlines into account to improve its accuracy.

## Career

### Software Engineer, Macquarie, (Jul 2024 – Present)
Joined the Corporate Operations Group Division Graduate programme.

### Junior Research Associate, University of Sussex, (May 2023 – Sep 2023)
During the Summer of 2023, I embarked on a research journey to find a correlation between the semantics of breaking financial news headlines and market movement across the world. A key learning point from this project was that retrieving financial data is difficult as it is often behind a paywall, making your models susceptible to having poor performance as garbage in tends to be garbage out. Through this project I gained a lot of skills related to data engineering, computational finance and machine learning. I used pandas for data engineering, LangChain to interact with my models and to store time series in an SQL database, and stored word embeddings in a vector database for later usage (and save OpenAPI credits).

The results of this project come in two parts, the first is the [neural-network-driven interactive map made with nomic.ai](https://atlas.nomic.ai/map/9efda517-1095-44f2-8db8-9698f1fc1dc4/f5f14db9-e284-429d-9a81-5d3706ef6c03?xs=-55.17357&xf=53.19966&ys=-30.02962&yf=29.91699), which is a visual map that shows the relationship between intra-day market movement and breaking news headlines across various markets. You can filter the headlines by tag or words, and check the metadata such as the timestamp, headline title, price difference and volatility before and after different time frames.

The second half was an automatic tagging tool. By training and hyperparameter tuning (with Bayesian optimisation) a Transformer neural network model on our tagged headline dataset we were able to predict tags of future headlines that had not yet been tagged with 90% accuracy.

### Software Engineer Intern (Payments), Thought Machine, (Jul 2022 – Sep 2022)
In my freshman year of University in 2022, I interned at a fast-moving cloud native core banking scale up, Thought Machine. I was placed in the payments department where I worked on a Golang library to validate client-configured payment processes using graph theory. Core software engineering skills that were developed include test-driven development, Protocol Buffers and Please build system. Afterwards, I put forward an idea via a technical design document, collaborating with product managers, software engineers and site reliability engineers to monitor how the Golang library was being used, along with the design architecture arguments for both observability frameworks, Prometheus or Elasticsearch. This allowed for a positive product feedback loop to improve documentation surrounding the limitations of creating payment flows based on common errors. My project found usage straight away from internal product managers and was core to the progression of the client-configured product space.

### Software Engineer, FinancialJuice, (Jul 2020 – Dec 2021)
FinancialJuice served as my introduction to both Natural Language Processing and Finance. My projects at FinancialJuice included grouping together semantically similar headlines using a novel Jaro-Winkler and Bag-of-Words algorithm, and creating a trending news feature similar to X (formerly Twitter) based on advanced text analysis techniques such as Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Named Entity Recognition made with C\#. Implemented the algorithm into a usable web component for in-house analysts with jQuery and ASP.NET, improving daily heaxqdline output by 35%.

### Junior Software Engineer, Tradeviews, (Dec 2018 – Aug 2020) 
My first job in tech involved automatic data collection with web scraping in Python, and data engineering to transform the data into a coherent format such as CSV, JSON and XLSX, and pipelining the data using Pentaho so it could be shipped to clients. I increased the data sources by 150% and with more data products we were able to secure 4 new major clients.
